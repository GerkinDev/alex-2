services:

    # If you need to access services in a test, create an alias
    # and then fetch that alias from the container. As a convention,
    # aliases are prefixed with test. For example:
    #
    # test.App\Service\MyService: '@App\Service\MyService'
    test.App\Service\Cart: '@App\Service\Cart'

#    app.cart:
#        class: App\Service\Cart
#        arguments: ['%doctrine.orm.entity_manager.class%', '%vich_uploader.templating.helper.uploader_helper%']
